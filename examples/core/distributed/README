This demonstrates how to run distributed applications by running multiple
stand-alone servers.

process.py
  This comprises the web application.
  Start a single server listening on 127.0.0.1 on port 5000:
    ./process.py --bind :5000
	Start 3 servers listening on port 5000, 5001 and 5002:
    ./process.py --bind :5000 --spawn 3
  
  Note:
    (This process is programmed to die after 4 requests in order to test
    fail-over and load balancing. You can disable this by editing the self-
    explaining instance variable called "die_after_num_requests" in
    process.py to have the value -1.)

lighttpd.conf
  After you have started one or more processes (on port 5000-5002), this 
  configuration will setup a FastCGI-connection between lighttpd and the 
  process and serve requests just as it would with a "local" process.
  
    lighttpd -Df lighttpd.conf
